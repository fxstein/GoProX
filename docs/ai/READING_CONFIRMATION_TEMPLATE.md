## **Example Summaries**

### **AI Instructions Summary Examples:**
- ✅ "Complete understanding of project standards, release processes, behavioral guidelines, Cursor capabilities for GitHub CLI access, mandatory requirements for release summaries, issue management, and progress validation"
- ✅ "Project standards, release checklist requirements, output management rules, script language requirements (zsh), issue assignment to fxstein, progress validation requirements, and CI/CD monitoring obligations"

### **Design Principles Summary Examples:**
- ✅ "Core principles: simplicity first, consistent parameter processing with zparseopts, structured logging standards (mandatory for all new scripts), human-readable configuration, progressive enhancement, platform consistency, error handling with clear messages, documentation-driven development, comprehensive testing framework, local linting, and Homebrew standardization"
- ✅ "Architectural decisions: mandatory logger integration for all scripts, zparseopts for parameter validation, output management to output/ directory, testing requirements for all features, and design decision documentation process"

### **Release Summary Instructions Summary Examples:**
- ✅ "Required content sections: New GoPro Models, Official Firmware, Labs Firmware, Core Functionality, Infrastructure. Content prioritization: primary focus on GoProX functionality, secondary on CI/CD. Formatting: no main header, bullet points, group firmware by model and type"
- ✅ "File requirements: latest-major-changes-since-<BASE>.md format, content prioritization with user-facing features first, required sections for models and firmware, formatting rules without main headers"

### **Next Steps Summary Examples:**
- ✅ "Current priorities: [specific priorities from document], implementation guidelines, recent changes tracking, and dependency chain requirements"
- ✅ "Foundation-first approach with clear phases, validation process for claimed completions, and immediate priority focus areas"

## **Enforcement Rules**

1. **NO WORK WITHOUT CONFIRMATION**: Must provide reading confirmation before any task
2. **COMPLETE SUMMARIES**: Each summary must show understanding of key points
3. **CONTEXT REFERENCE**: Reference specific principles/rules in responses
4. **SESSION REQUIREMENT**: Provide confirmation at start of every new session
5. **REFUSE TO PROCEED**: If cannot read required document, inform user and wait

## **Validation Checklist**

- [ ] All required documents read and understood
- [ ] Summaries show comprehension of key points
- [ ] Format matches template exactly
- [ ] Ready to reference specific principles in work
- [ ] No work performed before confirmation
