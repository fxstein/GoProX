# GoPro Labs Firmware URL Format

## Overview
GoPro Labs firmware files follow a predictable URL pattern on their GitHub media server, making it possible to construct URLs for firmware versions that may not be officially documented.

## URL Format
```
https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/gopro/labs/master/docs/firmware/lfs/LABS_{MODEL}_{VERSION}.zip
```

## Pattern Components
- **Base URL**: `https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/gopro/labs/master/docs/firmware/lfs/`
- **Prefix**: `LABS_`
- **Model**: Camera model identifier (e.g., `HERO11`)
- **Version**: Firmware version in format `XX_XX_XX_XX` (e.g., `02_32_70`)
- **Extension**: `.zip`

## Example
For HERO11 Black firmware version H22.01.02.32.70:
```
https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/gopro/labs/master/docs/firmware/lfs/LABS_HERO11_02_32_70.zip
```

## Version Format Conversion
Convert firmware version `H22.01.02.32.70` to URL format:
- Remove `H22.` prefix
- Replace dots with underscores
- Result: `02_32_70`

## Discovery Method
This pattern was discovered by comparing known labs firmware URLs and testing constructed URLs. The format appears to be consistent across different GoPro models and firmware versions.

## Usage
This pattern can be used to:
- Discover undocumented labs firmware versions
- Verify firmware availability before official release
- Automate firmware discovery for GoProX tools

## Note
Always verify firmware authenticity and compatibility before use. These URLs point to official GoPro Labs firmware hosted on GitHub's media server.
