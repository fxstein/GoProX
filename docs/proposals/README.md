# Structural Change Proposals

This directory contains proposals for significant structural changes to the GoProX project. These proposals are created by the AI assistant when large or complex structural changes are being considered.

## Purpose

Structural changes affect the entire project organization and can impact:
- Development workflow
- Documentation structure
- Maintenance procedures
- User experience
- CI/CD processes

Proposals ensure changes are well-thought-out and align with project goals before implementation.

## Proposal Naming Convention

Proposals follow this naming pattern:
```
PROPOSAL-YYYY-MM-DD-DESCRIPTIVE-NAME.md
```

Examples:
- `PROPOSAL-2024-01-15-feature-planning-restructure.md`
- `PROPOSAL-2024-01-20-script-organization.md`
- `PROPOSAL-2024-01-25-documentation-reorganization.md`

## Proposal Content
