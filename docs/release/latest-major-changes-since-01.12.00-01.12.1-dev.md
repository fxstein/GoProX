- **Branch validation warnings** - Clear warnings when operating on unexpected branches
- **Flexible dry-run policy** - Allow dry-run validation on any branch while maintaining strict real release controls
- **Branch mismatch detection** - Automatic detection and warning for branch-related errors

### Development Workflow Automation
- **Separate fix branch creation** - Automated script for creating dedicated branches for unrelated fixes
- **Fix branch naming conventions** - Standardized naming with type, description, and timestamp
- **Issue linking support** - Optional GitHub issue number integration in fix branches
