# Issue #20: Git-flow Model Implementation

**Issue Title**: Workflow: Implement git-flow Model  
**Status**: Open  
**Assignee**: Unassigned  
**Labels**: workflow

## Overview

Implement a more formal contribution model for GoProX by migrating from the current main-only workflow to the git-flow model, as described in the [GitHub Flow documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Capabilities
- All development happens in the `main` branch
- No formal branching model
- Direct commits and merges
- Minimal review process

### Current Limitations
- No feature or release branches
- Difficult to manage multiple contributors
- No formal review or testing process
- Risk of unstable main branch

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Branching Model Adoption (High Priority)
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

#### 1.1 Branch Types
- `main`: Stable, production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Feature development branches
- `release/*`: Release preparation branches
- `hotfix/*`: Urgent fixes for production

#### 1.2 Branching Workflow
```zsh
# Example workflow
# Start a new feature
 git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature develop
# Finish feature and merge
 git checkout develop
 git merge feature/awesome-feature
# Prepare a release
 git checkout -b release/1.0.0 develop
# Hotfix
 git checkout -b hotfix/urgent-fix main
```

### Phase 2: Contribution Guidelines (High Priority)
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

#### 2.1 Documentation
- Update CONTRIBUTING.md with git-flow instructions
- Add branch naming conventions
- Document pull request and review process

#### 2.2 Pre-commit and CI Integration
- Add pre-commit hooks for linting and tests
- Require CI checks before merging
- Enforce branch protection rules

### Phase 3: Training and Onboarding (Medium Priority)
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

#### 3.1 Contributor Training
- Provide git-flow training resources
- Host onboarding sessions for new contributors
- Document common workflows and troubleshooting

## Technical Design

### Branch Protection Rules
- Require PR reviews before merging to `main` or `develop`
- Require passing CI checks
- Enforce linear history (no merge commits)
- Restrict force pushes

### Pull Request Workflow
- All changes via PRs
- Review and approval required
- Automated tests and linting
- Clear description and issue references

### Release Process
- Use `release/*` branches for version bumps
- Tag releases on `main`
- Update changelogs and documentation

## Integration Points

### GitHub Actions
- Integrate CI/CD for all branches
- Automate tests, linting, and releases

### Documentation
- Update README and CONTRIBUTING.md
- Provide git-flow diagrams and examples

### Development Workflow
- Encourage feature branch development
- Enforce code review and testing

## Success Metrics

- **Stability**: Fewer bugs in main branch
- **Collaboration**: Easier multi-contributor workflow
- **Quality**: Higher code quality via reviews
- **Release Management**: Smoother, more predictable releases

## Dependencies

- Existing CI/CD setup
- Contributor engagement
- Documentation updates

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Well-documented model
- Incremental adoption possible
- Reversible if needed

### Medium Risk
- Contributor learning curve
- Initial workflow disruption
- CI/CD integration challenges

### High Risk
- Resistance to process change
- Branch management complexity
- Merge conflicts

### Mitigation Strategies
- Provide clear documentation
- Offer training and support
- Monitor and adjust workflow as needed

## Testing Strategy

### Workflow Testing
- Test branch creation and merging
- Validate CI/CD integration
- Simulate release and hotfix scenarios

### Contributor Feedback
- Gather feedback from contributors
- Adjust workflow based on experience

## Example Usage

```zsh
# Start a new feature
git checkout -b feature/new-feature develop
# Submit a pull request for review
git push origin feature/new-feature
# Merge after approval and CI pass
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Update documentation
2. **Week 1**: Set up branch protection rules
3. **Week 2**: Train contributors
4. **Week 3**: Monitor and refine workflow
