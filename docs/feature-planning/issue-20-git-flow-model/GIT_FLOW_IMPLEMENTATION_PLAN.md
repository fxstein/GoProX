# Git-flow Implementation Plan for Issue #20

**Status**: Deferred - Foundation Priority  
**Strategic Assessment**: Complete foundation infrastructure before workflow changes

## Executive Summary

This plan provides a strategic approach to implementing git-flow for the GoProX project, taking into account the current foundation-first development priorities and ensuring the workflow enhancement supports rather than disrupts core development.

## Current Project Context

### Foundation-First Development Strategy
The GoProX project is currently following a **Foundation First** approach as outlined in `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`:

**Phase 1 Priorities (Current):**
- Platform abstraction layer
- Configuration management system
- Data management systems
- Enhanced default behavior (#67)

**Rationale for Foundation Priority:**
- Core infrastructure gaps must be addressed before workflow improvements
- Platform abstraction and configuration management are critical for project stability
- Data management systems are prerequisites for advanced features
- Foundation completion will provide stable base for effective git-flow implementation

### Current Development State
- **Workflow**: Main-only development with direct commits
- **Team Size**: Small, focused development team
- **Development Pace**: Rapid iteration and feature development
- **CI/CD**: Basic GitHub Actions workflows in place
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing framework implemented

## Strategic Assessment

### Phase 3: Git-flow Implementation (Post-Preparation)
**Timeline**: After preparation activities  
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 completion  
**Impact**: High

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Branch Protection Setup**
   - Configure GitHub branch protection rules
   - Require PR reviews for main and develop branches
   - Enforce CI checks before merging
   - Restrict force pushes

2. **Branch Structure Creation**
   - Create develop branch from main
   - Set up feature branch workflow
   - Configure release and hotfix branches
   - Implement branch naming conventions

3. **Workflow Migration**
   - Migrate current development to develop branch
   - Implement feature branch workflow
   - Set up release branch process
   - Configure hotfix workflow

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Branch Protection Configuration

**Main Branch Protection:**
```yaml
# GitHub branch protection rules
- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Restrict force pushes
- Allow specified actors to bypass restrictions
```

**Develop Branch Protection:**
```yaml
# Similar to main but with development-specific rules
- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Allow force pushes for administrators only
```

### Branch Naming Conventions

**Feature Branches:**
```
feature/issue-XX-descriptive-name
feature/67-enhanced-default-behavior
feature/70-architecture-design-principles
```

**Release Branches:**
```
release/01.11.00
release/01.12.00
```

**Hotfix Branches:**
```
hotfix/critical-bug-fix
hotfix/security-patch
```

### Pull Request Workflow

**Standard PR Process:**
1. Create feature branch from develop
2. Implement feature with tests
3. Create pull request to develop
4. Require code review and CI checks
5. Merge after approval

**Release PR Process:**
1. Create release branch from develop
2. Update version and documentation
3. Create pull request to main
4. Require code review and CI checks
5. Merge to main and tag release
6. Merge back to develop

### CI/CD Integration

**Branch-Specific Workflows:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop, feature/*, release/*, hotfix/*]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]
```

**Required Checks:**
- YAML linting
- Shell script validation
- Test suite execution
- Documentation validation

## Conclusion

Git-flow implementation is a valuable workflow enhancement that will improve code quality, collaboration, and release management. However, the current foundation-first development strategy requires completing core infrastructure before implementing workflow changes.

**Recommendation**: Defer git-flow implementation until foundation infrastructure is complete, then implement using the phased approach outlined in this plan.

This approach ensures that:
- Core functionality is stable before workflow changes
- Git-flow implementation builds on solid foundation
- Team can focus on high-impact infrastructure work
- Future git-flow implementation will be more effective
