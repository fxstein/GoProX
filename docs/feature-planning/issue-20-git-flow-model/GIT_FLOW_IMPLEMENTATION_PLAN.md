# Git-flow Implementation Plan for Issue #20

**Status**: Ready for Implementation  
**Scope**: Git-flow implementation for current repository

## Summary

This plan provides a focused approach to implementing git-flow for the GoProX project, addressing the current main-only workflow and establishing a more structured development process with multi-channel release support for Homebrew packages.

## Multi-Channel Release Strategy

### Release Channels Overview

**1. Dev Build Channel (develop branch)**
- **Purpose**: Continuous integration builds for development testing
- **Source**: `develop` branch
- **Audience**: Developers, early adopters, testing
- **Installation**: `brew install fxstein/tap/goprox@dev`
- **Update Frequency**: On every develop branch push
- **Stability**: Development quality, may contain bugs

**2. Beta Channel (release branches)**
- **Purpose**: Pre-release testing and validation
- **Source**: `release/*` branches
- **Audience**: Beta testers, advanced users
- **Installation**: `brew install fxstein/tap/goprox@beta`
- **Update Frequency**: On release branch creation and updates
- **Stability**: Release candidate quality, feature complete

**3. Official Channel (main branch)**
- **Purpose**: Stable production releases
- **Source**: `main` branch (tagged releases)
- **Audience**: General users, production environments
- **Installation**: `brew install fxstein/tap/goprox` (default)
- **Update Frequency**: On official releases only
- **Stability**: Production quality, thoroughly tested

### Channel Management Strategy

**Homebrew Formula Structure:**
```ruby
# Formula/goprox.rb - Official channel (default)
class Goprox < Formula
  desc "GoPro media management tool"
  homepage "https://github.com/fxstein/GoProX"
  version "01.11.00"
  url "https://github.com/fxstein/GoProX/archive/v01.11.00.tar.gz"
  sha256 "..."
  
  depends_on "zsh"
  depends_on "exiftool"
  depends_on "jq"
  
  def install
    # Installation logic
  end
end

# Formula/goprox@beta.rb - Beta channel
class GoproxBeta < Formula
  desc "GoPro media management tool (beta)"
  homepage "https://github.com/fxstein/GoProX"
  version "01.11.00-beta.1"
  url "https://github.com/fxstein/GoProX/archive/v01.11.00-beta.1.tar.gz"
  sha256 "..."
  
  depends_on "zsh"
  depends_on "exiftool"
  depends_on "jq"
  
  def install
    # Installation logic
  end
end

# Formula/goprox@dev.rb - Dev build channel
class GoproxDev < Formula
  desc "GoPro media management tool (development build)"
  homepage "https://github.com/fxstein/GoProX"
  version "01.11.00-dev.$(date +%Y%m%d)"
  url "https://github.com/fxstein/GoProX/archive/develop.tar.gz"
  sha256 "..."
  
  depends_on "zsh"
  depends_on "exiftool"
  depends_on "jq"
  
  def install
    # Installation logic
  end
end
```

### CI/CD Workflow Integration

**Multi-Channel Release Workflows:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/release-channels.yml
name: Multi-Channel Release Management

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build Dev Version
      - name: Update Homebrew Dev Channel
        env:
          HOMEBREW_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.HOMEBREW_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          # Update goprox@dev formula
          ./scripts/release/update-homebrew-channel.zsh dev

  beta-release:
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/heads/release/')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build Beta Version
      - name: Update Homebrew Beta Channel
        env:
          HOMEBREW_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.HOMEBREW_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          # Update goprox@beta formula
          ./scripts/release/update-homebrew-channel.zsh beta

  official-release:
    if: github.event_name == 'release' && github.event.action == 'published'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build Official Version
      - name: Update Homebrew Official Channel
        env:
          HOMEBREW_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.HOMEBREW_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          # Update goprox formula (official)
          ./scripts/release/update-homebrew-channel.zsh official
```

### Channel Update Scripts

**Homebrew Channel Management:**
```zsh
#!/bin/zsh
# scripts/release/update-homebrew-channel.zsh

# Update Homebrew formula for specific channel
# Usage: ./update-homebrew-channel.zsh [dev|beta|official]

local channel="$1"
local version=""
local url=""
local sha256=""

case $channel in
  dev)
    version="$(date +%Y%m%d)-dev"
    url="https://github.com/fxstein/GoProX/archive/develop.tar.gz"
    ;;
  beta)
    version="$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)-beta.$(date +%Y%m%d)"
    url="https://github.com/fxstein/GoProX/archive/$(git rev-parse HEAD).tar.gz"
    ;;
  official)
    version="$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)"
    url="https://github.com/fxstein/GoProX/archive/v${version}.tar.gz"
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Error: Invalid channel. Use: dev, beta, or official"
    exit 1
    ;;
esac

# Calculate SHA256
sha256=$(curl -sL "$url" | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1)

# Update Homebrew formula
_update_homebrew_formula "$channel" "$version" "$url" "$sha256"
```

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Branch Protection Configuration

**Main Branch Protection:**
```yaml
# GitHub branch protection rules
- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Restrict force pushes
- Allow specified actors to bypass restrictions
```

**Develop Branch Protection:**
```yaml
# Similar to main but with development-specific rules
- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Allow force pushes for administrators only
```

### Branch Naming Conventions

**Feature Branches:**
```
feature/issue-XX-descriptive-name
feature/67-enhanced-default-behavior
feature/70-architecture-design-principles
```

**Release Branches:**
```
release/01.11.00
release/01.12.00
```

**Hotfix Branches:**
```
hotfix/critical-bug-fix
hotfix/security-patch
```

### Pull Request Workflow

**Standard PR Process:**
1. Create feature branch from develop
2. Implement feature with tests
3. Create pull request to develop
4. Require code review and CI checks
5. Merge after approval

**Release PR Process:**
1. Create release branch from develop
2. Update version and documentation
3. Create pull request to main
4. Require code review and CI checks
5. Merge to main and tag release
6. Merge back to develop

### CI/CD Integration

**Branch-Specific Workflows:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop, feature/*, release/*, hotfix/*]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]
```

**Required Checks:**
- YAML linting
- Shell script validation
