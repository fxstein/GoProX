# Issue #4: Automatic Imports

**Issue Title**: Feature: Automatic Imports  
**Status**: Open  
**Assignee**: fxstein  
**Labels**: feature, automation, import, workflow

## Overview

Implement automatic import functionality to streamline the media import process by automatically detecting and importing new media from connected devices and storage locations.

## Current State

GoProX currently requires manual specification of source directories and explicit import commands. Users must:
- Manually identify source directories
- Run import commands with explicit paths
- Monitor import progress manually
- Handle import errors and edge cases
- Repeat process for multiple sources

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Automatic Source Detection
**Priority**: High

#### 1.1 Device Detection
Implement automatic device detection:
- GoPro SD card detection and mounting
- USB storage device detection
- Network storage location discovery
- Cloud storage integration

#### 1.2 Content Discovery
Add intelligent content discovery:
- Media file type detection
- Metadata extraction and validation
- Duplicate detection and handling
- Content organization and categorization

### Phase 2: Automated Import Workflow
**Priority**: High

#### 2.1 Smart Import Pipeline
Create automated import workflows:
- Automatic source validation
- Intelligent file organization
- Progress monitoring and reporting
- Error handling and recovery

#### 2.2 Import Optimization
Implement import optimization:
- Parallel processing for multiple sources
- Incremental import capabilities
- Storage optimization and management
- Performance monitoring and tuning

### Phase 3: Advanced Import Features
**Priority**: Medium

#### 3.1 Intelligent Import Decisions
- Content-aware import strategies
- Automatic quality assessment
- Import priority optimization
- Storage requirement prediction

#### 3.2 User Experience Enhancement
- Interactive import progress
- Import preview and validation
- Automatic import scheduling
- Import history and analytics

## Technical Design

### Automatic Detection System
```zsh
# Device and content detection
function detect_import_sources() {
    # Scan for connected devices
    # Identify media storage locations
    # Validate content and metadata
    # Return structured source information
}

function validate_import_content() {
    local source_path="$1"
    # Validate media files
    # Extract metadata
    # Check for duplicates
    # Return validation results
}
```

### Automated Import Engine
```zsh
# Intelligent import workflow
function execute_automatic_import() {
    local sources="$1"
    local config="$2"
    
    # Validate all sources
    # Execute import pipeline
    # Monitor progress and errors
    # Provide user feedback
}

function optimize_import_process() {
    local content_analysis="$1"
    # Optimize import strategy
    # Configure parallel processing
    # Set storage optimization
    # Return optimized configuration
}
```

### Import Monitoring System
```zsh
# Progress monitoring and reporting
function monitor_import_progress() {
    local import_id="$1"
    # Track import progress
    # Report status updates
    # Handle errors and recovery
    # Provide user notifications
}
```
