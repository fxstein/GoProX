# Issue #73: Intelligent Media Management Assistant

**Issue Title**: Enhanced Default Behavior: Intelligent Media Management Assistant  
**Status**: Open  
**Assignee**: fxstein  
**Labels**: enhancement, default-behavior, media-management, automation

## Overview

Transform GoProX into an intelligent media management assistant that automatically detects, processes, and manages GoPro media with minimal user intervention while maintaining full control when needed.

## Current State

GoProX currently requires manual configuration and explicit command execution for each operation. Users must:
- Manually specify source and library directories
- Run separate commands for archive, import, process, and clean
- Manually check for firmware updates
- Configure each operation individually
- Handle errors and edge cases manually

## Implementation Strategy

- Automatic mount point detection
- Camera model identification
- Firmware version checking
- Media file discovery and validation

#### 1.2 Smart Default Configuration
Create intelligent default behavior:
- Automatic library structure creation
- Optimal processing settings based on content
- Environment-aware configuration
- Multi-system synchronization

### Phase 2: Automated Workflow Management
**Priority**: High

#### 2.1 Intelligent Processing Pipeline
Implement automated processing workflows:
- Archive-first processing strategy
- Smart import and processing decisions
- Automatic cleanup and optimization
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms

#### 2.2 Context-Aware Operations
Add intelligent context awareness:
- Travel vs. office environment detection
- Multi-card workflow management
- Storage optimization and management
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### Phase 3: Advanced Intelligence Features
**Priority**: Medium

#### 3.1 Predictive Processing
- Content analysis and categorization
- Processing priority optimization
- Storage requirement prediction
- Performance optimization recommendations

#### 3.2 User Experience Enhancement
- Interactive progress reporting
- Intelligent error handling and recovery
- Contextual help and guidance
- Workflow optimization suggestions

## Technical Design

### Intelligent Detection System
```zsh
# Automatic GoPro detection
function detect_gopro_cards() {
    # Scan for mounted GoPro SD cards
    # Identify camera models and firmware
    # Validate media content
    # Return structured card information
}

function analyze_media_content() {
    local source_dir="$1"
    # Analyze media files and metadata
    # Determine optimal processing strategy
    # Identify special requirements
    # Return processing recommendations
}
```

### Smart Default Configuration
```zsh
# Environment-aware configuration
function detect_environment() {
    # Detect travel vs. office environment
    # Identify available storage
    # Determine network connectivity
    # Return environment configuration
}

function create_smart_config() {
    local environment="$1"
    local media_analysis="$2"
    # Create optimal configuration
    # Set processing parameters
    # Configure storage strategy
    # Return configuration object
}
```

### Automated Workflow Engine
```zsh
# Intelligent processing pipeline
function execute_smart_workflow() {
    local gopro_cards="$1"
    local config="$2"
    
    # Execute archive-first strategy
    # Process based on content analysis
    # Handle errors and recovery
    # Provide progress feedback
}
```
