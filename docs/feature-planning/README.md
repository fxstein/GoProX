# Feature Planning Documentation

This directory is organized by GitHub issue, with each issue having its own directory directly under `feature-planning/`, named as `issue-XX-title/` (where XX is the zero-padded issue number and title is a short, kebab-case description).

## Directory Structure

- `issue-XX-title/` — All files related to Issue XX (e.g., documentation, plans, implementation details)
- `README.md` — This overview and navigation guide

## How to Navigate

1. **Find the Issue:**
   - Browse the top-level directories in `feature-planning/` and select the relevant `issue-XX-title/` directory.
2. **Explore Related Files:**
   - Each issue directory contains all documentation, plans, and supporting files for that feature or enhancement.
3. **Add New Documentation:**
   - Place new files for a feature or enhancement in the corresponding `issue-XX-title/` directory.
   - Use clear, descriptive filenames within each issue directory.

## Example

```
feature-planning/
  README.md
  issue-04-automatic-imports/
    ISSUE-4-AUTOMATIC_IMPORTS.md
  issue-67-enhanced-default-behavior/
    ISSUE-67-ENHANCED_DEFAULT_BEHAVIOR.md
    DEFAULT_BEHAVIOR_PLAN.md
    DEFAULT_BEHAVIOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md
  issue-70-architecture-design-principles/
    ISSUE-70-ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md
    FEATURE_ANALYSIS.md
  ...
```

## Adding New Issues

1. Create a new directory: `issue-XX-title/`
2. Add all related documentation and planning files to that directory.
3. Update this README if needed to clarify navigation or structure.

## Notes

- All previous issue files have been moved into their respective directories.
- This structure ensures all planning and documentation for a feature is grouped together for easy access and maintenance.
