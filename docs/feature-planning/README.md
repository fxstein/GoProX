## Navigation Guidelines

### For Developers
1. **Start with [FEATURE_ANALYSIS.md](FEATURE_ANALYSIS.md)** for overall project roadmap
2. **Check specific issue files** for detailed implementation plans
3. **Reference closed issues** for completed work patterns

### For Feature Planning
1. **Create issue-specific files** using the naming convention: `ISSUE-XX-DESCRIPTIVE_NAME.md`
2. **Update this README** when adding new issue documentation
3. **Link related documents** within issue files for cross-referencing

### For Implementation
1. **Follow the implementation plan** outlined in each issue file
2. **Update issue status** when work is completed
3. **Move completed issues** to closed status and update documentation

## File Naming Convention

All issue-based files follow this pattern:
```
ISSUE-XX-DESCRIPTIVE_NAME.md
```

Where:
- `XX` = GitHub issue number (padded with zeros if needed)
- `DESCRIPTIVE_NAME` = Short, descriptive name in UPPERCASE with underscores

## Status Tracking

- **Open Issues**: Active development, implementation in progress
- **Closed Issues**: Completed work, reference for patterns
- **General Documents**: Ongoing planning and analysis

## Related Documentation

- **[Architecture Design Principles](../architecture/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md)** - Core architectural decisions
- **[Next Steps](../NEXT_STEPS.md)** - Current priorities and progress
- **[Testing Framework](../testing/TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md)** - Testing standards and procedures
