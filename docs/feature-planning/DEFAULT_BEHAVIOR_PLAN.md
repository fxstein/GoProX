# GoProX Default Behavior Enhancement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the current default behavior of GoProX and proposes an enhanced default behavior system that provides a more intuitive, automated, and user-friendly experience. The goal is to make GoProX work seamlessly out-of-the-box while maintaining the flexibility for advanced users.

## Current Default Behavior Analysis

### What Happens When You Run `goprox` Without Arguments

Currently, when `goprox` is run without any arguments, it executes the `_detect_and_rename_gopro_sd()` function, which:

1. **Scans for GoPro SD Cards**: Searches `/Volumes/*` for mounted volumes
2. **Identifies GoPro Cards**: Looks for `MISC/version.txt` files containing "camera type"
3. **Extracts Camera Information**: Reads camera type, serial number, and firmware version
4. **Proposes Volume Renaming**: Suggests renaming volumes to `CAMERA_TYPE-SERIAL_LAST_4` format
5. **Checks Firmware Updates**: Identifies if newer firmware is available (official or labs)
6. **Interactive Prompts**: Asks user for confirmation on rename and firmware update actions

### Current Limitations

1. **No First-Time Setup**: No guided initial configuration
2. **Limited Automation**: Requires manual confirmation for every action
3. **No Media Processing**: Doesn't automatically import or process media files
4. **No Library Management**: Doesn't set up or manage the media library
5. **No Persistent Configuration**: Doesn't remember user preferences
6. **No Error Recovery**: Limited handling of edge cases and failures

## Proposed Enhanced Default Behavior

### Phase 1: First-Time Run Experience

#### Initial Setup Flow
When `goprox` is run for the first time on a system (no config file exists):

1. **Welcome and Introduction**
   ```
   Welcome to GoProX v01.10.00!
   
   GoProX is your GoPro media management assistant. Let's get you set up.
   ```

2. **Library Configuration**
   - Suggest default library location: `~/goprox`
   - Allow user to specify custom location
   - Create library structure automatically
   - Validate write permissions

3. **Processing Preferences**
   - Ask about automatic import preferences
   - Configure default processing options
   - Set up copyright information
   - Choose firmware update preferences

4. **SD Card Detection Setup**
   - Explain automatic SD card detection
   - Configure mount event handling
   - Set up launch agent for automatic processing

5. **Configuration Persistence**
   - Save all preferences to `~/.goprox`
   - Create backup of configuration
   - Provide configuration validation

#### Configuration File Structure
```bash
# GoProX Configuration File
LIBRARY=~/goprox
COPYRIGHT=""
GEONAMES_ACCOUNT=""

# Default Processing Options
AUTO_IMPORT=true
AUTO_PROCESS=true
AUTO_ARCHIVE=true
AUTO_CLEAN=true
AUTO_FIRMWARE_CHECK=true

# SD Card Preferences
AUTO_RENAME_SD_CARDS=true
FIRMWARE_TYPE=official  # official, labs, or both
PROMPT_FOR_CONFIRMATION=false

# Mount Event Configuration
MOUNT_OPTIONS=(--archive --import --clean --firmware)
ENABLE_LAUNCH_AGENT=true

# Advanced Options
LOG_LEVEL=2
QUIET_MODE=false
```

### Phase 2: Subsequent Run Behavior

#### Normal Operation Flow
When `goprox` is run on subsequent occasions:

1. **Configuration Validation**
   - Check if config file exists and is valid
   - Validate library directory and permissions
   - Verify dependencies are installed

2. **SD Card Detection and Processing**
   - Scan for mounted GoPro SD cards
   - For each detected card:
     - Check if it's been processed before
     - Determine appropriate actions based on content
     - Execute configured workflows

3. **Smart Decision Making**
   - **New SD Card with Media**: Import and process automatically
   - **Previously Processed Card**: Check for new content only
   - **Empty SD Card**: Offer to format or skip
   - **Multiple Cards**: Process each independently

#### Enhanced SD Card Detection Logic

```bash
function _enhanced_sd_card_processing() {
  for volume in /Volumes/*; do
    if _is_gopro_card "$volume"; then
      local card_state=$(_determine_card_state "$volume")
      
      case $card_state in
        "new_with_media")
          _process_new_card_with_media "$volume"
          ;;
        "new_empty")
          _handle_empty_card "$volume"
          ;;
        "previously_processed")
          _check_for_new_content "$volume"
          ;;
        "needs_firmware_update")
          _offer_firmware_update "$volume"
          ;;
        "error_state")
          _handle_card_error "$volume"
          ;;
      esac
    fi
  done
}
```

### Phase 3: Smart Content Detection

#### Media Content Analysis
For each detected SD card, analyze the content:

1. **Content Detection**
   - Count media files (JPG, MP4, 360, etc.)
   - Check for existing processed markers
   - Determine if card is empty or has content

2. **Processing Decision Matrix**
   ```
   Card State                    Action
   ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
   New card with media          ‚Üí Import + Process + Archive
   New card, empty              ‚Üí Offer format or skip
   Previously processed         ‚Üí Check for new content only
   Has firmware update          ‚Üí Offer update first
   Error state                  ‚Üí Report and skip
   ```

3. **Batch Processing**
   - Process multiple cards simultaneously
   - Provide progress indicators
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Continue processing other cards if one fails

### Phase 4: User Experience Enhancements

#### Interactive vs. Automated Modes
Provide two operation modes:

1. **Guided Mode** (Default for new users)
   - Clear explanations of what's happening
   - Confirmation prompts for important actions
   - Progress indicators and status updates
   - Helpful error messages and recovery suggestions

2. **Automated Mode** (For experienced users)
   - Silent operation with minimal output
   - Automatic decision making based on configuration
   - Log file generation for review
   - Email notifications for completion/failures

#### Status and Progress Reporting
