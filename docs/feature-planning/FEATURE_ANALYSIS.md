## Conflicting Requirements

### Storage Management Conflicts

**Issue**: Multiple features propose different storage optimization strategies
- **#26 (Delta Patch Compression)**: Compress imported files to delta patches
- **#10 (Multi-Tier Storage)**: Distribute files across multiple storage devices
- **#11 (AWS Glacier)**: Archive files to cloud storage
- **#64 (Exclude Firmware Zip)**: Remove firmware files from repository

**Resolution Strategy**:
- Implement a unified storage management layer that can handle multiple strategies
- Allow users to choose which optimization strategy to apply
- Ensure strategies can work together (e.g., delta compression before cloud archival)

### Platform Support Conflicts

**Issue**: Cross-platform features may have conflicting requirements
- **#2 (Windows Support)**: Adapt for Windows environments
- **#59 (FreeBSD Port)**: Create FreeBSD package
- **#38 (Timezone Independent Tests)**: Ensure consistent behavior across platforms

**Resolution Strategy**:
- Create platform abstraction layer early
- Implement #38 first to ensure consistent testing across platforms
- Use platform detection to apply appropriate strategies

### Workflow Integration Conflicts

**Issue**: Enhanced workflows may conflict with existing processes
- **#67 (Enhanced Default Behavior)**: Automatic SD card detection
- **#69 (Enhanced SD Card Management)**: Multi-card workflows
- **#4 (Automatic Imports)**: Launch agent integration

**Resolution Strategy**:
- Implement #67 as foundation for #69
- Ensure all automatic features can be disabled
- Create configuration system to manage workflow preferences

### Repository Organization Conflicts

**Issue**: Repository cleanup may affect other features
- **#66 (Repository Cleanup)**: Reorganize scripts and implement Git LFS
- **#60 (Firmware URL Fetch)**: Remove firmware files from repository
- **#65 (Firmware Automation)**: Maintain firmware registry

**Resolution Strategy**:
- Implement #66 first to establish new organization
- Ensure #60 and #65 work with new structure
- Create migration scripts for existing users
