# Release Process Debug Issues

This document tracks issues encountered while debugging the SHA256 mismatch problem in the GoProX release process.

## Issues Encountered During Debugging

### 1. GitHub CLI Command Issues
```zsh
# These commands failed with "head: |: No such file or directory" errors:
gh run list --workflow="release-automation.yml" --limit 1
gh run list --workflow release-automation.yml
gh secret list
```

### 2. Workflow Analysis Issues
- **Can't access GitHub Actions logs** - The `gh` CLI isn't working properly
- **Can't verify if `HOMEBREW_TOKEN` secret exists** - This is critical for the `update-homebrew` job
- **Can't see workflow execution status** - Need to determine if the job ran, failed, or was skipped

### 3. Root Cause Analysis Gaps
- **Unknown if `update-homebrew` job executed** - The job depends on `create-release` but we can't verify it ran
- **Unknown if `HOMEBREW_TOKEN` is configured** - This is required for cross-repository access
- **Unknown if timing issues occurred** - GitHub tarball availability timing
- **Unknown if permission issues exist** - Token permissions for homebrew-fxstein repository

### 4. Workflow Logic Issues Identified
- **Timing dependency** - `update-homebrew` runs immediately after `create-release`
- **No error reporting** - If `HOMEBREW_TOKEN` is missing, job fails silently
- **No verification** - No step to verify the Homebrew formula was actually updated

## Proposed Fixes

### Fix 1: Improve GitHub CLI Debugging
```zsh
# Test basic gh functionality
gh --version
gh auth status

# Test workflow access
gh workflow list
gh run list --limit 5
```

### Fix 2: Add Better Error Handling to Workflow
- Add explicit error checking for `HOMEBREW_TOKEN`
- Add verification step to confirm formula update
- Add better logging and error reporting

### Fix 3: Add Workflow Verification Steps
- Add step to verify Homebrew formula was updated correctly
- Add step to test the SHA256 calculation
- Add step to report success/failure status

### Fix 4: Improve Timing and Retry Logic
- Increase propagation delay
- Add more robust retry mechanism
- Add verification that tarball is actually available

## Current Status

- **Release v01.00.03 created successfully** on GitHub
- **Homebrew formula still has old SHA256** (`d5558cd419c8d46bdc958064cb97f963d1ea793866414c025906ec15033512ed`)
- **Correct SHA256 for v01.00.03** is `0ec6206aa176f9e354c6441d68363f04eae36b4d9a96ce1587eff168bb199da5`
- **`update-homebrew` job likely failed** or didn't run properly

## Next Steps

1. Fix GitHub CLI debugging issues
2. Improve workflow error handling and verification
3. Test the fixes with a new release
4. Verify Homebrew formula updates correctly
