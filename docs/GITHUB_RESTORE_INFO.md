# GitHub Repository Restore Information

This file contains the information needed to restore the GitHub remote connection after removing media files from the entire Git history.

## Repository Information
- **Repository URL**: https://github.com/fxstein/GoProX.git
- **Default Branch**: main
- **Current HEAD**: 2d3b09e (Remove remaining media files with uppercase extensions)

## Remote Configuration
```zsh
# Current remote configuration
origin  https://github.com/fxstein/GoProX.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/fxstein/GoProX.git (push)
```

## Steps to Restore GitHub Connection

### 1. Remove Current Remote (if needed)
```zsh
git remote remove origin
```

### 2. Add GitHub Remote Back
```zsh
git remote add origin https://github.com/fxstein/GoProX.git
```

### 3. Verify Remote Configuration
```zsh
git remote -v
```

### 4. Force Push Cleaned Repository
```zsh
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

### 5. Verify Connection
```zsh
git fetch origin
git status
```

## Important Notes

- **Backup Created**: GoProX-backup-20250119-143000 (in parent directory)
- **Backup Branch**: backup-before-cleanup-20250119-143000 (created by cleanup script)
- **Force Push Required**: After history rewrite, a force push will be necessary
- **LFS Configuration**: Git LFS settings in .gitattributes will be preserved
- **Branch Structure**: Only main branch exists, no other branches to worry about

## Pre-Cleanup State
- Repository size: ~9.5GB
- Git directory: ~9.2GB
- Media files in history: 166 files
- Media files: Removed from working directory but still in history
- LFS tracking: Configured but files removed from working directory

## Expected Post-Cleanup Benefits
- Significantly reduced repository size
- Faster clone/pull operations
- Better GitHub compatibility
- Cleaner Git history

## Cleanup Method
- Using `git filter-branch` (built into Git)
- Script: `cleanup_history.zsh`
- Removes all media files with extensions: jpg, jpeg, png, mp4, mov, heic, 360, dng, insp, insv (both cases)
